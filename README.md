# Perline
Perline names a "one sentence per line" text style.
For documents with a maximum line width,
  any sentences exceeding the maximum line width split over further lines
  at logical places using rules based on punctuation and grammar.
In Perline, all lines hold a self-contained part of a sentence.

The project combines 
  the Perline text style,
  a two-way converter, 
  and a live playground site.
The two-way converter 
  unwraps Perline to normal text,
  and wraps normal text to Perline.
The live playground edits and presents text in both formats.
