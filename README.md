# Perline
The project combines the Perline text style,
  a two-way converter, and a live playground site.
For soft wrap documents, Perline simply means
  "one sentence per line".
For documents with maximum line widths,
  any long sentences split at logical places over further lines.
In Perline, all lines hold a self-contained part of a sentence.
The two-way converter wraps normal text to Perline,
  and unwraps Perline to normal text.
The live playground edits and presents text in both formats.
