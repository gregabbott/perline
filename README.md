# Perline
Perline names a "one sentence per line" text format.
For documents with maximum line widths,
  any long sentences split at logical places over further lines.
In Perline, all lines hold a self-contained part of a sentence.

The project combines the Perline text style,
  a two-way converter, and a live playground site.
The two-way converter unwraps Perline to normal text,
   and wraps normal text to Perline.
The live playground edits and presents text in both formats.
